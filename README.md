Mixer Upper

This is a dynamic webpage which provides users an easy and convenient to discover and create sophisticated cocktails. Cocktails can be searched by name or by ingredient, and receive an image of the cocktail, a list of ingredients and instructions on how to prepare it. Below this are four cards presenting random cocktails to allow discovery of new drinks. 

The page includes buttons to post to Twitter and Facebook, as well as a button to open Google Maps and find the users closest cocktail bar. 

Materialize was used for CSS, and the header includes the carousel feature, and can be seen mid-change in the first image. Javascript uses the Jquery library, and the Montserrat font family is from Google Fonts. The details for the cocktails are drawn from The Cocktail Database (thecocktaildb.com) through its API.
